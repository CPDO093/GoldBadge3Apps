This project is a collection of three console applications. 

## Description of projects
Komodo Badges 
- This console application uses a dictionary were the key is the badge number and the value is which doors that badge can access. It has methods to 
  add new badges and the door(s) it casn acces as well as methods for updating the badges access to doors(remove or add) and a method to list ass currrent badges. 
  This was the most tricky one for me and I'm still not conviced it workes 100%.

  of all outings or specific types of outings.
